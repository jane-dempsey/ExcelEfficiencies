# ExcelEfficiencies
Making reports I typically run in excel more efficient with other programming languages


"Organization Status Cleaner" - A script that cleans the data from company's Organization Contract Status Report. This Report reviews what outstanding items over 150+ organizations and their staff must complete, per our company's background check and onboarding policies. The csv is a test file (with dummy data) and the xlsx is the output after running the script. This is version 1, I have plans to streamline the script so it is not as repetitive and clunky.
